blurb:
  heading: Why Grumps?
  text: All plants and bonsai are carefully grown indoors, pest free with my own
    mix of substrate or soil. Growing these plants and bonsai brings me immense
    joy. I would like to extend this plant joy to others, which is why I have
    decided to sell some of my plants and bonsai. Also, i have limited space in
    my home :P

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
