blurb:
  heading: Why Grumps?
  text: All plants and bonsai are carefully grown indoors, pest free with my own
    mix of substrate or soil. Growing these plants and bonsai brings me immense
    joy. I would like to extend this plant joy to others, which is why I have
    decided to sell some of my plants and bonsai. Also, i have limited space in
    my home :P
