    text: Welcome to Grumps Greenery! I indulge my passion for plants by cultivating
      them from seeds and cuttings, and now, I'm excited to share the beauty of
      these plants with you. Through my hands-on approach, I repurpose ceramic
      teacups into bonsai pots and adding essential features like drainage
      holes. Crafting my own substrate and soil mix, I ensure a nurturing
      environment for these botanical wonders. Join me on this journey to be
      less grumpy, where i share my love for plants and see how care and grow
      them.
